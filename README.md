## To-Do

### Figure out how to install the authority to the Firefox Windows root store

https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/issues/266

### Figure out if I need to copy over the authority or can generate it again

Using two computers, do I need to generate the CA on one, copy it over to the
other and install the same CA on both, or can I run `mkcert -install` on each
machine and will the certificates generated by either of the two CAs be valid
to the other CA?

### Figure out how to use the generated certificate with the Node server
